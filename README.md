# Original brainstorming session:

# slack_bot
A group project where we developed a slack bot to increase productivity

 **SlackOff Bot**
Problem: People are stressed, they need to cool down.

How to Solve: We will create a SlackOffBot that sends messages that are triggered by specific words like stress/ed, overwhelmed, break, busy, etc.  and will send a calming      message pulled from the internet or a self-created database. 

Why this is worth solving: To alleviate the pain of being overworked, helps them be more productive. 

Design: Monitoring messages of #general or a specific channel, then it is triggered by "Please give me a joke", or "Please give me advice" and it will return a message.
If individuals say those keywords over a specified limit within a certain timespan, a message will be output to that user giving them different de-stress methods and says, "you need a break, try one of these methods to chill out."

# NOTE
You *must* run the app.py before starting ngrok.exe to start up.
